# cmake practice 
Here I have some practice code for the book [cmake practice](http://sewm.pku.edu.cn/src/paradise/reference/CMake%20Practice.pdf).

Actually, the contents in the book are not always right due to non-lasting maintainance. So I kinda modified the notes to make it fit the grammer of today's cmake rules.

## Prerequisites
- gcc/g++ 5.4.0
- cmake 3.5.1

## To Do
- [ ] Add in grammer notes.
