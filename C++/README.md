# C++

## File Structure
Here I include the notes and codes for two books:
- [x] C++程序设计,written by 谭浩强, etc
  - Corresponding files are stored in folder `Tan`.
- [ ] C++ Primer, written by Stanley B.Lippman, etc;
  - Related files are placed in Folder `Primer`.

## Note
- For your information, I finished reading Tan's book first. So I worte many notes for Tan's book, whereas the notes I wrote for `C++ Primer` are mainly supplementary to the former one.

- Howerver, for there are out-of-time concepts and some lapses contained in Tan's book, the notes for all important concepts in C++(say class, derivation,etc)  are mainly based on book *C++ Primer*.
